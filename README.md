# Portfolio

<!-- made navbar, made it respond to width of window with a container, shared navbar and container with contact.html and portfolio.html since they all had to all be consistent, added content in about me, contact me, and portfolio, went back to navbar to make the links expand when the page was big enough and turn into a hamburger menu when it was small (very diffucult this is where i spent most of my time) confirmed that my html was working with w3's validation service-->
